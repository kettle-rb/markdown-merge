module Markdown
  module Merge
    # Defines structural spacing rules for markdown elements.
    #
    # When merging markdown from different sources, gap lines from the original
    # sources may not exist at transition points (e.g., when a dest-only table
    # is followed by a template-only table). This module defines which node types
    # require spacing before/after them for proper markdown formatting.
    #
    # Node types are categorized by their spacing needs:
    # - NEEDS_BLANK_BEFORE: Nodes that need a blank line before them (headings, tables, etc.)
    # - NEEDS_BLANK_AFTER: Nodes that need a blank line after them
    # - CONTIGUOUS_TYPES: Nodes that should NOT have blank lines between consecutive instances
    #   (e.g., link_definition blocks should be together)
    #
    # @example
    #   MarkdownStructure.needs_blank_before?(:table)  # => true
    #   MarkdownStructure.needs_blank_after?(:heading) # => true
    #   MarkdownStructure.contiguous_type?(:link_definition) # => true
